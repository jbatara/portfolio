## Description

_This is a website created to showcase my work as a web developer. It will be updated from time to time as my skillset grows._

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* Internet
* Browser

_An internet connection is needed for 4 things:_
* Actually accessing the Website
* Downloading the Google font
* Downloading bootstrap
* Downloading the Font Awesome font icons


## Known Bugs

_Accessing the site (even after downloading the html and css components) without an internet connection has been the cause of the Font Awesome icons disappearing. Saving a local file of the icon library would amend this_
